1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by listening carefully to requirements, asking clarifying questions, and breaking down broad goals into smaller, specific tasks. Creating user stories helps because they put the focus on what the user actually wants to achieve, not just technical details. User stories give context by describing the “who,” “what,” and “why” of a feature, which makes it easier to design solutions that directly support user goals.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs, I try to approach the work in small, manageable pieces rather than trying to build everything at once. Using Agile processes like sprints, backlog prioritization, and iterative testing helps me stay organized and focused on delivering value regularly. In the future, I want to continue using practices like daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives, since they encourage communication and continuous improvement. These processes not only keep the team aligned but also make sure that we can adapt to changes along the way.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means more than just writing code. It’s about communication, collaboration, and dependability. A good team member shares progress openly, helps others solve problems, and respects different perspectives. It also means being adaptable, willing to learn, and keeping the focus on building a product that benefits the user. Supporting the team’s goals while contributing individual skills is what makes development successful.
